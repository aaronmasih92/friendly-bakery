 Ronnie sweet spot is a fictional Bakery located in the heart of New York City . This website showcases various products, prices and information about the bakery. I wanted to show users that I am capable of creating sleek websites to showcase products.   can also see the catalog of products listing and pricing via email. 



This project was built in Ruby with the Sinatra gem! It is a lightweight micro framework that allows to create routes and HTML templates easily. I stylized the page with Materialize. 



 the website is designed to mimic the feel of an actual website that sells products and is trying to reach out to customers period so you reach the homepage you're going to experience the history the reputation and the impact that this establishment has . and then when you travel throughout the site you will find pictures of the products with their names and their prices . 

lastly if you have any questions comments you can write that on the contact page.  in return I programmed sending  catalog to the user's email.
