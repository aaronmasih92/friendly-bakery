# Ronnie's Sweet Spot
Ronnie's Sweet Spot is a fictional Bakery located in the heart of New York City . This website showcases various products, product prices and historical information about the bakery. I wanted to show users that I am capable of creating sleek websites to showcase products and a business. One can also receive a text rendition of the catalog of products listing via email. 


The website is designed to mimic the feel of an actual website that sells products and is trying to reach out to customers. When you reach the homepage you're going to experience the history, the reputation and the impact that this establishment has. Traveling through the site will via the navigation bar will show you all of our products and prices.


Lastly, if you have any questions comments you can write that on the contact page. In return, I programmed the of sending the catalog to the user's email.
