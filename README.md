"Ronnie's Sweet Spot" is an imaginary bakery located in the heart of NYC. Thank you for taking the time to read this!!!

I (Aaron Masih) created this project while spending time taking the software engineering intensive course at the New York Code & Design Academy in 2018. 

This project seeks to recreate the look and feel of a modern day bakery website!
